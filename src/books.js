    title: "Live and Let Others Live': Life Lessons from Mahavira",
    description:
      "Mahavira was a sixth-century reformer and philosopher, the twenty-fourth Tirthankara of the Jains, who established Jainism as a new faith.  Having attained omniscience (kevala jnana) after performing austerities for twelve years, Mahavira began travelling on foot, preaching and gaining followers. A great believer in the equality of all, he ordained men and women from all classes and castes. He taught his followers how to overthrow the fetters of karma and liberate the soul from the cycle of birth and rebirth as well as lessons on how to live a life of truthfulness, compassion, humility and non-attachment. The Upanishadic dictum—ahimsa paramo dharmah (non-violence is the greatest Truth)—saw its apogee in the teachings of Mahavira. His teachings on the symbiosis between all living beings and the five elements— earth, air, fire, water and vegetation—form the basis of environmental sciences today. Edited by Nanditha Krishna, the aphorisms in ‘Live and Let Others Live’ contain the core teachings of Mahavira that show us how to lead a peaceful and fulfilling life.",

    description:
      "This is the story of how Jainism has shaped the life of a teenager who strives to understand the world and make it a better place. From cultivating and nurturing his beliefs to altering his perceptions, from instilling in him greater sensibility and sensitivity to influencing his actions and hobbies, Anchit Jain’s faith has been the anchor in his life, providing him with a holistic prism through which to view the world. As Anchit narrates how and why his religion matters to him, the readers are led on a journey that explores the fundamental tenets as well as the little-known aspects of the Jain way of life, with reason showing the way to faith and the need for Jainism in today’s world. Enriched by Anchit’s simple yet sharp analyses and punctuated by his humorous anecdotes, this is a documentation of Jainism not from the ivory towers of scholastic wisdom but through the mundane and momentous incidents that make up everyday reality.",

      "Connect: How to Find Clarity and Expand Your Consciousness with Pineal Gland Meditation",
    description:
      "Are you feeling stuck in your current situation or your life in general? Are you having trouble managing stress? Have you sought answers at spiritual retreats without getting the clarity you need? Relief can be closer than you think if you reframe how you look at your problems. New York Times bestselling author Ilchi Lee proposes there is one root cause to all the troubles plaguing us―separation. We put up walls in every aspect of our lives, isolating ourselves. Those walls keep us from forming healthy relationships with others, with nature, and even with ourselves. But separation has a simple cure―finding a way to connect. In Connect: How to Find Clarity and Expand Your Consciousness with Pineal Gland Meditation, Lee shows how to connect to your authentic self through the pineal gland in your brain. Activate your pineal gland through the meditations rooted in an ancient Korean tradition that Ilchi Lee describes in this book. You’ll experience clarity instead of emotion, compassion rather than judgment, and  holeness in place of separation. This book will help you find the solutions you seek by opening the inner eye that leads to greater clarity regarding the health of your body, the dreams of your soul, and the wisdom of your spirit.",

      "Reflecting the increasing recognition of the importance of the spiritual in healing, Spirituality and Art Therapy is an exciting exploration of the different ways in which the spiritual forms an essential, life-enhancing component of a well-rounded therapeutic approach. The contributors are leading art therapists who write from diverse perspectives, including Christian, Jewish, Buddhist and shamanic. They explain how their own spiritual and creative influences interact, finding expression in the use of art as a healing agent with specific populations, such as bereaved children, emotionally disturbed adolescents, and the homeless. The relationships between spirituality and visual art, art therapy and transpersonal psychology are examined. Story and image are interwoven in the spiritual journeys of therapists and clients, and suggested creative exercises make this an accessible, practical resource for those who desire to understand and execute an holistic method of therapy. Arguing that art therapists can mediate between the sacred and the mundane, this pioneering book is an affirmation of the transformative power of art therapy.",
